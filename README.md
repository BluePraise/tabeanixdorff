## To whomever it may concern. 
Currently it is April 2022.
This project was designed by Tabea Nixdorff.
The developer is Magalie Chetrit.
The project is built with WordPress and has it's own custom theme. 

### ACF BLOCKS - How it works
Posts are used for the projects. So if T wants to upload a project she needs to add a new post. These are then sent to index.php

## Project Specifics.
- Filters 
- ACF
- Search 

### May 2022 - V0.1
My aim is to make this the most streamlined - slimmed WP theme ever. 

- Uses ACF Blocks to render templates - V0.1
- Custom search filter added - V0.1
- Added a conditional to the projects block for single view
- Navigation: improved positioning on hover

### June 2022 - V0.2
 
- Moved js folder to assets folder 
- Registered a new acf block to add columns in project (columns_5050)
- Single: now has improved markup
- Index: now has improved markup
