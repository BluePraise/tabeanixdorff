## To whomever it may concern. 
Currently it is April 2022.
This project was designed by Tabea Nixdorff.
The developer is Magalie Chetrit.
The project is built with WordPress and has it's own custom theme. 

### ACF BLOCKS - How it works
Posts are used for the projects. So if T wants to upload a project she needs to add a new post. These are then sent to index.php

## Project Specifics.
